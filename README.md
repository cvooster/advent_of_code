# Advent of Code

Personal repository for solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 
puzzles. The solutions are written using Python 3.11.3 and do not rely on
third-party modules. However, because the scripts import a module from the
"common" directory, that directory should be added to the PYTHONPATH
environment variable. The code has been formatted using
[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), version 23.3.0, with the
line length set at 80 characters.
